#Game Of Life

The *Game Of Life* is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.


#Rules

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


#How to play

Use the left button of your mouse to select the living cells. With the right button of your mouse you can delete them.
Once you have finished your desired settings, press any key to start. If you press any key again, the game will stop and you will be able to modify the current settings, having to press any key again to resume the game.
